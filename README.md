## What does it add? 
Test your skin id of your Minecraft legacy(WiiU...) skin pack if you have the same id

## How to do ?
- Run the .exe
- Enter the id of your skin in the console
- If the id of your skin does not exist yet then a certain message will be displayed in the console to say that it is good and the id will be saved in the text file
- Else a message will appear to say that it already exists
